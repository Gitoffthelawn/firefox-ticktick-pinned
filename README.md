## Introduction

A Firefox extension to open or toggle a pinned tab with TickTick Web within it. This extension also adds a shortcut, and a button toggle within the toolbar.

## How to Use

1. Toggle the pinned tab by pressing _`Alt+Shift+5`_. This shortcut can be changed by going to _`Add-ons` → `TickTick Pinned` → `Options`_.
2. If you prefer buttons over shortcuts, there is a toolbar button you can press to toggle the pinned tab.

## Disclaimer

This extension is an independent project, has no relationship, and is not affiliated to TickTick in any way. This extension is primarily for personal use; a personal project if you will. This add-on <i>only</i> opens their web app in a pinned tab.
